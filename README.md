# Been There, Done That!

Been There, Done That! is a World of Warcraft character achievement tracker that enables a user to pull data on their character in the popular MMO World of Warcraft and show them achievements they have completed on their characters as well as achievements they have not completed and gives helpful links for information on how to complete them.

## Getting Started

The deployed app link is [here](https://btdt-achievements.herokuapp.com/), simply click on the 'search' link in the navigation bar. Enter in your character name and realm name and press submit. It will load your character's name and achievement count. Click the name and it will list all achievements completed and incomplete. Click any achievement and it will show you the achievement requirements in a separate page. 

## Future Updates

I will be adding a feature that allows a user to login with their Battle.Net account and that will pull up all their characters and their achievements with that.
